To the hiring agencies doing detective work on me, hello! This page is mostly designed for you. I will provide a biography of myself as well as my aspirations and goals in life. I will also supply some fun facts I enjoy as well as any other random quips I wish to include!

### Biography
I was born in Evansville, Indiana, also known as the armpit of America for how hot and humid it gets here. I attended St. Ben's elementary school from 1st to 8th grade. In grade school, I was a bit of a nuisance to my teachers as I was a kid with a crazy imagination and boatloads of energy. I played basketball for precisely one year and scored precisely one goal. I also played soccer recreationally for a local sports team. Otherwise, my time was spent playing video games and hanging out with my friends whom I still hang out with to this day. I have ADD, so focusing on studies was always a challenge for me. I performed slightly below average in grade school and those habits carried on into high school.

In high school, I kept those same bad study habits but with much less energy and spunk to myself. I was placed in lower level classes and was not involved much in school activities. I did join the bowling team which I participated in all 4 years. I also joined the history club my senior year and went on a culturally enriching trip through the eastern United States. Other than that, I saw high school as a glorified day care where I would show up and leave after 8 hours. I didn't go to any dances or other school hosted events. I don't even have a senior picture in the yearbook! During the later half of high school, I found an express interest in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Having an innate interest in these subjects helped my study habits, but I still performed subpar in classes like Precalculus and Algebra 2. My senior year, however, was my redemption arc. After being behind consistently in science classes, I finally caught up to the big boys and girls and was able to take Physics honors. This was one of my favorite classes, alongside trigonometry, and received an A in both classes. I scraped by high school with a very lukewarm GPA of around 3.0 - 3.1.

College was a transformative experience for me. The freedom college gave me allowed me to structure my study habits to cater to my somewhat unconventional learning style. I was initially rejected from my choice school of Purdue University (College of Science) due to subpar grades and lack of any extracirricular activites. Thus, I enrolled at Ball State in 2016 majoring in Computer Science, then switching to Physics. I was part of the Society of Physics students at Ball State, an awesome group of individuals who had the same love of science as I did. We held events for local schools and participated in fun activities dealing with anything related to Physics. Suprisingly, I finished with a 3.92 GPA my freshman year, and I knew I had an opportunity to attend my dream college of Purdue. I applied and was accepted in Fall 2017 into the College of Science with a major of Physics. After realizing I absolutely abhor physics labs, I switched to mathematics and statistics. At Purdue, I did undergrad research with an awesome professor named Erik Otarola Castillo. I helped him with neat tasks that deal with understanding early human beings, as well as a neat statistical program that looks at how different artefacts differ from each other in terms of their shape. 

I graduated from Purdue University in 2020 with a triple major in mathematics, statistics, and applied mathematics with a 3.73 GPA. I was proud to receive A's in all the major Purdue weedout classes such as Calculus or Real Analysis. My favorite class was Fourier Analysis, where we dived deep into the properties of Fourier series and the Fourier transform. My undergraduate experience helped me mature in my study habits as well as allow me to have a deeper appreciation of mathematics and made me realize how little I really knew (in a good way)! It also made me realize that failure is not the final outcome. I failed a lot throughout my life. They key was that I learned from my failures and used them to propell myself even further.

As I write this (May 22, 2020), I am an incoming graduate student at Cornell University aiming to get my master's in operations research. I hope to become an Operations Research Analyst and work in the healthcare industry or something related to science. I never would have fathomed that I would have made it this far, and I hope to continue my journey in my career and dedicate my life to progressing the world one step further.
