## Austin Lutterbach's Personal Github Page

To the hiring agencies doing detective work on me, hello! This page is mostly designed to ensure you that I am not a strung out cocaine addict or selling secrets to the Chinese.

### Biography
I was born in Evansville, Indiana, also known as the armpit of America for how hot and humid it gets here. I attended St. Ben's elementary school from 1st to 8th grade. In grade school, I was a bit of a nuisance to my teachers as I was a kid with a crazy imagination and boatloads of energy. I played basketball for precisely one year and scored precisely one goal. I also played soccer recreationally for a local sports team. Otherwise, my time was spent playing video games and hanging out with my friends whom I still hang out with to this day. I enrolled at Reitz Memorial High school, a private Catholic school, in 2012. I was part of the bowling team for all 4 years and was a member of the history club for 1 year. I was the "student of the month" for my trigonometry class. Otherwise, I had a very lackluster high school career. I never snuck out with my friends to smoke the ganj and vandalize mailboxes. I didn't attend events like prom where I could engage in socially acceptable alcoholism, or the senior retreat where I missed out on a very spiritual cocaine binge in the camp bathroom which I'm sure was an excellent bonding experience. I never got my senior picture taken as it required one to wear a suit, and I didn't want my parents to spend 200 bucks. I scraped by with a 3.1~ GPA. 

After graduating high school in 2016, I applied to Purdue but was rejected. I went to Ball State, had an epiphany, ended up with a 3.92 GPA my freshman year and transferred to Purdue. At Purdue I did undergrad research in the anthropology department where I helped design some statistical software to figure out how artefacts differ by shape. I enjoyed a fairly relaxed college life and had many outings to the Neon Cactus. I ended up graduating from Purdue in 2020 with a 3.73 GPA majoring in mathematics, statisics, and applied mathematics. I am now currently a graduate student at Cornell University pursuing a Master's in Operations Research. I failed many times to get to where I am at. I am not afraid of failure. I see it as a tool to learn of my shortcomings and then correcting those hindrances to propell me even further than if I hadn't failed.

### Hobbies
- My father is a musician, so I have an affinity for music. I am currently learning the piano and plan on taking some singing classes as well. I enjoy all types of genres of music, from country to metal to rap to rock to classical. You name it, I like it. My current favorite artists are Vampire Weekend and Peach Pit

- I workout regularly. I workout for strength rather than aesthetic. My goal is to reach 2 plate bench press before I am 25.

- I enjoy reading. Like all early to mid 20s white males interested in literature, I plan on reading *Infinite Jest* by DFW.

- I would be lying if I didn't say the majority of my time is spent playing vidoe games. Currently, I have been enjoying *Red Dead Redemption 2*. I also enjoy strategy games like *Eu4* or *Rise of Nations*.

- I am continuing my mathematics journey, and I consider myself to be a hobbyist mathematician. I am working through the textbook *All of Statistics* by Larry Wasserman to review some concepts from my statistics major. Afterwards, I plan on working through a text on differential geometry as I would love to intuitively understand general relativity. 

- My favorite hobby is not selling classified and secret information to foreign powers.
