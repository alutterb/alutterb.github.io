To the hiring agencies doing detective work on me, hello! This page is mostly designed for you. I will provide a biography of myself as well as my aspirations and goals in life.

### Biography
I was born in Evansville, Indiana, also known as the armpit of America for how hot and humid it gets here. I attended St. Ben's elementary school from 1st to 8th grade. In grade school, I was a bit of a nuisance to my teachers as I was a kid with a crazy imagination and boatloads of energy. I played basketball for precisely one year and scored precisely one goal. I also played soccer recreationally for a local sports team. Otherwise, my time was spent playing video games and hanging out with my friends whom I still hang out with to this day. I have ADD, so focusing on studies was always a challenge for me. I enrolled at Reitz Memorial High school in 2012. I was part of the bowling team for all 4 years. Otherwise, I had a very lackluster high school career. I didn't attend any events such as the dances or senior trips. I didn't even get my senior picture taken! I scraped by with a 3.1~ GPA. 

After graduating high school in 2016, I applied to Purdue but was rejected. I went to Ball State, had an epiphany, ended up with a 3.92 GPA my freshman year and transferred to Purdue. At Purdue I did undergrad research in the anthropology department where I helped design some statistical software to figure out how artefacts differ by shape. I ended up graduating from Purdue in 2020 with a 3.73 GPA majoring in mathematics, statisics, and applied mathematics. I am now currently a graduate student at Cornell University pursuing a Master's in Operations Research. I failed many times to get to where I am at. I am not afraid of failure. I see it as a tool to learn of my shortcomings and then correcting those hindrances to propell me even further than if I hadn't failed.

### Hobbies
- My father is a musician, so I have an affinity for music. I am currently learning the piano and plan on taking some singing classes as well. I enjoy all types of genres of music, from country to metal to rap to rock to classical. You name it, I like it.

- I workout regularly. I workout for strength rather than aesthetic. My goal is to reach 2 plate bench press before I am 25.

- I enjoy reading. Like all early to mid 20s white males interested in literature, I plan on reading *Infinite Jest* by DFW.

- I would be lying if I didn't say the majority of my time is spent playing vidoe games. Currently, I have been enjoying *Red Dead Redemption 2*. I also enjoy strategy games like *Eu4* or *Rise of Nations*.

- I am continuing my mathematics journey, and I consider myself to be a hobbyist mathematician. I am working through the textbook *All of Statistics* by Larry Wasserman to review some concepts from my statistics major. Afterwards, I plan on working through a text on differential geometry as I would love to intuitively understand general relativity. 


### Goals and aspirations
- Program effeciently in an OOP language
- Master the piano
- Fully understand general relativity 
- Reach two plate bench press
- Own a Tesla
- Learn leading industry optimization tools
- Have my own personal library filled math/physics textbooks
- Graduate from Cornell and land a fulfilling job in healthcare or science industry
- Learn Russian or German
- Understand the field of Topology
- Climb a mountain
- Travel on the Trans-Siberian railway
- Drink vodka in Moscow
- Set foot on Antarctica
